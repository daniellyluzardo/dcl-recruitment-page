# dcl-recruitment-page
This framework is going to give coverage for different features of the web application of recruitment-page.

* Main scenarios covered on this project
* Login - Succesfully login
* Validate elements at Login Page
* Validate elements at Recruitment Page
* Add a new candidate at Recruitment Page
* Edit candidate at Recruitment Page:
      * * Im considering, in this scenario, any candidate created by add a new candidate feature, since its necessary to run those independently as sometimes one browser will run in random order, it is difficult to assure that the immediate previous scenario will be edited, to achieve this goal, it would be a E2E test, validating also the API calls before running each scenario. Also Ive noticed that sometimes the candidate that was recently added was not displayed in the search to edit it, so to investigate this and prevent fails, I would have to check on API to see if the candidate was added to the database correctly.
* Set user as recruiter (TBD since it is not in the scope)

## Project setup
---------------------
### Pre-requisites: 
* Install NodeJS
* Install Playwright
    npm init playwright@latest, mainly choose TypeScript and true to install browsers
	TypeScript
	true (npx playwright install)

# Opening the project
clone repo on git clone https://github.com/daniellyluzardo/dcl-recruitment-page.git then
git init

# Opening the project
### Using NPM

- Run `npm i` to install the project dependencies

### Using Yarn

- Run `yarn` to install the project dependencies

### Manual installation of dependencies:
If the `npm install` command is not working you can follow this step to install all the dependencies manually:
* Install playwright: `npm init playwright@latest`
* Install allure-command line tools `npm install @wdio/allure-reporter --save-dev` and 
`npm install -g allure-commandline --save-dev` and 
`npm install --save-dev allure-playwright` or
`npm install --save-dev @playwright/test allure-playwright`and
`npx playwright test --reporter=line,allure-playwright`
* Install dotenv using: `npm i dotenv`

## Project Execution
---------------------

### Run the tests
* To run tests locally you can use: `npx playwright test`
* To run tests locally and generate reports, you can use: `npx playwright test --reporter=line,allure-playwright`

### Paralelism
* Due the nature of some tests, Ive decided to set workers to 1 at time to be able to run separatedly on each browser with less errors, you can check this worker setup on `playwright.config.ts`

### Language settings/Localization
* Sometimes the credentials provided in the Login page logs in a user that is set as a different language than english, which is the main language used to code these scripts, it is possible to set the language to english via coding adding a new test case, also it can be change via postman, but currently this feature is not in the scope so if the runs are not running correctly, check manually if the current user is set to english, if it is not, change language overall in the website > Admin > Configuration > Localization > Language dropbox > English

### Enabling Recruitment Module to current user
* Sometimes the credentials provided in the Login page logs in a user that doesn't have recruitment module enabled, so to be able to correctly run those to recruit a candidate > go to Admin > Configuration > Modules > Module Configuration and mark Recruitment Module true and Save, the Recruitment menu item should be displayed

## Reports
---------------------
After running `npx playwright test --reporter=line,allure-playwright` a folder named `allure-results` will be generated so to generate report you need to follow:
* To generate the reports use int terminal: `allure generate allure-results --clean`
* To open the reports you can run in terminal: `allure open ./allure-report`
* You can also use HTML report that is default to playwright on: `npx playwright show-report`
